The files contained in this repository (https://github.com/carolzhou/PhATE_docs) comprise supplementary files in support of the manuscrupt, "PhATE: bioinformatics pipeline for annotation of phage isolates", by C. E. Zhou et al., submitted to Bioinformatics as an Application Note / software article. The following files are included:

1) phate_Fig_1_PhATE_Workflow.pdf - Overview of the workflow for the PhATE annotation pipeline. A configuration file and a phage genome are input to the system. The configuration file controls code execution, which consists of gene finding followed by (optional) sequence annotations. Output files are written to the user-specified subdirectory.

2) phate_LYP264_45_clustalo.pdf - A Clustal Omega alignment showing the LYP264_45 gene call (predicted by PHANOTATE) aligned with two pVOG groups and a top-hit E. coli protein.

3) phate_LYP264_sequenceAnnotation_main.out.txt - A sample of the main output from the PhATE pipeline. Gene and peptide sequences are written in order along the genome, each with tabbed data fiels comprising BLAST and HMM search results. This output can be viewed in MS-Word or Mac Pages. PhATE also outputs gff-formatted file for subsequent input to other third-party analysis programs.

4) phate_P2_CGC.pdf - sample output from the CGC (Compare Gene Calls) module within PhATE. Here is displayed a gene-by-gene comparison of gene calls from 4 gene callers. Gene calls that appear on the same line were identical (start and stop coordinates). At the top of the file are listed statistics for each gene caller and summary statistics regarding the comparison. This sample run for phage P2 demonstrated that PHANOTATE did not miss any gene calls for a well-annotated near-neighbor genome to LYP264.

5) phate_author_information.pdf - Information about NMRC authors; required information about NMRC authors when publishing.

6) phate_genome_annotation.pdf - Gene annotations for LYP264 and LYP215, derived from PhATE analysis.

7) phate_results.pdf - A sample study involving the sequencing of two novel phage isolates (LYP264 and LYP215), which were annotated using PhATE. Special interest was directed to lysis-related genes. One of the novel gene calls in LYP264 (#45) was found to have weak homology to any known phage gene, but strikingly high homology to an E. coli gene annotated as "primosomal protein". This gene was studied in more detail using an alignment-ready output file generated by PhATE.

8) phate_sequencing.pdf - Methods for sequencing of the two novel phage genomes.
